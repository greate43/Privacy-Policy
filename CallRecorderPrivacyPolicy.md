**Call Recorder - Privacy Policy**<br>
This document clarifies how User data and any sensitive information is handled in the App.
<br>
**Recording Call - Microphone**
We do not hold any recordings or User information on our own servers.

The App “Call Recorder” records phone calls. All recorded calls are recorded on the phone using the microphone on the device. The recorded files and related notes are stored on the phone’s storage and NO server is involved with recording phone calls. The recorded calls are not stored on our own server and can only be stored locally or on a third party cloud storage service such as Google Drive or Dropbox.



**Storage**
The App requests permission to access the phone’s storage only in order to store the recorded calls and play the recorded files afterwards. The App does not access any other files nor excess User’s photos.


**Contacts**
The App accesses the contacts on the phone in order to display the contacts that were recorded and so the App can record or ignore calls from specific contacts. The contacts information is NOT transmitted nor stored on any server.

**Third-party collected data**

The App uses several third parties in order to improve our services. These parties collect their own data. Please read their privacy policies (see the links below) to ensure that you’re comfortable with the manner in which they collect data.

**Ads**
Google Admob: The free version of our android Application includes some ads displayed with Google Admob.
